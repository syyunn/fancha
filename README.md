# FAN-CHA !

## About 
`FAN-CHA ! (Find Chinese Character!)` is to predict which Chinese character could be determined for given Korean word living in a sentence. 
There exists only a few restricted possibilities of Chinese Character Determination (Hereafter "CCD") because of its phonetic uniqueness. (Or sometimes there exists "no" correspondent Chinese Character since the Korean Word since it's pure-Korean word)
